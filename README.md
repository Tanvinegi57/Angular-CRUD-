# Angular CRUD Operations

This projects explains the basic CRUD operations on a table. You can add, edit and delete the product's record from the table. I have also used angular mui for the UI part.

## JSON SERVER

Json server is used to handle Database part.
For json-server you can install the json-server package using command - "npm i json-server"
and then use the following command - " npx json-server --watch db.json"
to run the json-server in your system.
